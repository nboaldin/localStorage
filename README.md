My friend needed a little script to show a modal that contained a form on
Sundays. He only wanted the form to show once and not again on refresh. I 
showed and/or hid the modal based on the day of the week and the value of
the key I stored in the browser's local storage. The html was written just to 
mock what was actually happening on his site. I had fun learning about
localStorage.
